		<p id="bl-txt">The MSc in Computer Science strikes the complete balance between theoretical and practical knowledge, highlighting the fascinating interaction between these two approaches. A great aspect of the course is its flexibility. I've been able build expand my knowledge on the key themes that I'm really interested in: Software Engineering, Information Systems, and Security.</p>

		<p id="bl-txt">Since graduation I have been working as a Graduate Consultant in a London-based IT company keen to promote an entrepreneurial spirit within the business.

					The game is based on a how fast you can type in the correct word matching the block. Aim of the game is to avoid the block touching the bottom of the screen. To do this you need to correctly input the word into the input bar, with every successful input you gain a point. After every 10 points you level up with the difficulty levels.

A Live application that the Academy utilises to record items that have been checkout out by various members or students at the academy.  
					The project involved a Product owner, Lead Dev and four members as the developers. The product owner had produced a list of features that he needed implemented into the application. Within the group of 4, features were broken down with priorities and shared between each member. This project massively involved communicating with the product owner and conflicts while pushing different features at the same time. The project was a success however, many lessons were learnt and experience gained from working as a group then working independently.</p>

In a group of 5 DevOps team, we built a 2-tier architecture, with 2 environments of developer and production. Each task was split within the team members while utilising GitHub. Tools like Jenkin, Chef, Terraform and packer was utilised to automate the whole infrastructure and making it into an immutable architecture. Many tasks included self-teaching and research such as auto scaling, Route 53, ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) which was a big challenge as the project was managed and provisioned through code also known as ‘infrastructure as code`. This introduced the team to work in a mob programming to produce results faster and keep everyone unto-date with the features.</p>
